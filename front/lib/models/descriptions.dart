Kazakhstan is a country with a low percentage of forest cover. According to the Forestry and Wildlife Committee of the Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources, in January 2022, forests covered 5 percent of the country's territory and their area is 13.6 million hectares. Almost half of them are saxaul. In general, due to the efforts aimed at forest protection, their restoration and sustable use, recent years has seen a tendency to increase the land under forests in Kazakhstan.
To date, Kazakhstan is taking steps to restore forests as part of the country's transition to a "green" economy.
